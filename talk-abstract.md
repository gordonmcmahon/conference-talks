# Experiments in mob programming

## Abstract

My team have been mob programming full-time since late 2016 in a multi-national corporate setting. I'd like to share some of our experiences and observations about this extended experiment. We'll be talking about the mechanics and practices around how we mob, the interesting changes to the team dynamic, and how it has re-shaped the team and allowed us to see benefits we had never imagined.
Session description

## Details

I have been running a mob programming team at JPMorgan since the end of 2016. This was the first full-time mob in the firm and this is the story of how we made it happen in the first place, the lessons we've learned on that journey, and some of the observations we've made about how our team now functions. This should be of interest to anyone thinking of trying out mob programming, or who actively do it and want to improve/address some specific mob problems.

This will be an extended and enriched version of a talk I've given internally at JPM more than once - which triggered waves of people trying out mob programming.

Below is a list of topics/lessons being covered (in no particular order...yet):

* Seeking permission or asking forgiveness to mob - getting started
* Physical & material difficulties
* Which activities worked well with a mob, and which did not.
* Dev/engineering practices that make it work
* How to manage occasionally remote team members.
* Team optimised for resiliency
* Team optimised for consistency
* Mobbing rules that we developed
* Being mindful of introverts in the mob
* Maximising the good, minimising the bad
* The team mind
* Handling ad-hoc demand (support, queries)
* Feedback & the "micro-retrospective"
* In a corporate setting, how can you differentiate mob members for EOY/compensation purposes
* Mobbing can be hard work and mentally taxing, how do we achieve sustainable pace
* Fighting groupthink and other mob dysfunctions
* Communication inside the team, communications outside team
* Recruiting into the mob
