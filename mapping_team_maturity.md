# Mapping Team Maturity to Support Improvements


## Abstract

The biggest challenge I face at J.P.Morgan's Glasgow Technology Hub is providing context-specific guidance to ~2000 software engineers in 300+ teams. This cannot be done effectively at scale on gut-feel or by following a rigid maturity model. So, building on Chris McDermott's Maturity Mapping paper and with Marc Burguer, we have been developing techniques to help teams to map their own maturity. We use this to help them gain situational awareness and to focus on which areas of improvement will be of most value to them. Once equipped with this information, we can deliver much more focused coaching and though their evolving maps, have the ability to judge how that has affected the team's maturity.

and is an active member of the local agile/lean software development community. 
Gordon first heard of Wardley Mapping at Lean Agile Scotland in 2016 - was fascinated but disappointed he didn't have any big 
strategy problems to apply it to. He now heads up the coaching services for J.P.Morgan's Glasgow Technology Hub and is using Wardley maps to inform and direct coaching engagements.
