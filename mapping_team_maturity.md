# Mapping Team Maturity to Support Improvements


## Abstract

I run coaching services for ~2000 developers at JPMorgan's Glasgow site. The biggest challenge we face is providing context-specific guidance to 300+ teams. This cannot be done effectively at scale on gut-feel or by following a rigid maturity model. So, building on Chris McDermott's Maturity Mapping paper and with Marc Burguer, we have been developing a workshop to help teams to map their own maturity. We use this to help them understand their current situation, and to focus on which areas of improvement will be of most value to them. Once equipped with this information, we can deliver much more targetted and specific coaching, and a mechanism for judging how that has affected the team's maturity, captured in their maps.

# Bio

Gordon McMahon is an agile software engineer and agile coach Glasgow, Scotland. He has been practicing XP & TDD since around 2002, 
and is an active member of the local agile/lean software development community. 
Gordon first heard of Wardley Mapping at Lean Agile Scotland in 2016 - was fascinated, but disappointed he didn't have any big 
strategy problems to apply it to. Now he is heading up the coaching services for JPMorgan's Glasgow site, and using Wardley maps to 
give teams situational awareness in terms of their maturity, which informs our coaching engagements.
