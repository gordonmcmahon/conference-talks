# Mapping Team Maturity to Support Improvements


## Context

#### The J.P.Morgan Situation
Providing context-sensitive coaching to 300+ teams - coaching group is new venture
Gut feel & agile maturity models are not cutting it


#### The Trouble With Maturity Models
Jason Yip:

"One of my main annoyances with most maturity models is not so much that they're simplified and linear, but more that they're suggesting a poor learning order, usually reflecting what's easier to what's harder rather than you should typically learn following this path, which may start with some difficult things.In other words, the maturity model conflates level of effectiveness with learning path"

"Using a maturity model to say one group is better than another is a classic example of ruining an informational metric by incentivizing it. My feeling that anyone doing an assessment should never publicize the current level outside of the group they are working with. " - Martin Fowler

"Adrian Howard points out that maturity for a 30 person company is entirely different to that of a multinational."

Marc Burgauer highlights “they also bias thinking towards the model, i.e. blindfold for context”. That is most maturity models encourage “gap thinking” which involves envisioning their view of an idealised future state and closing the gap. This, in turn, discourages options that might otherwise present themselves.

Maturity Models:
* Pre-scriptive
* Lock-step
* One-size-fits-all

Maturity Maps:
* Bespoke
* Context-sensitive
* Provides situational awareness to make better decisions
* rather than a prescribed path 


## Story

#### LASCOT 2016 - Meeting Mr Wardley

One of the more enlightening conference talks I've witnessed.
Disappointed I didn't have any problems like that


#### Solo research

Still fascinated with the idea of mapping, I tried playing with it on my own to examine the coaching problem

#### Lean Agile Glasgow - ChrisMcd Maturity Mapping paper

Chris McDermott presented his Maturity Mapping paper at Lean Agile Glasgow - we talked at length as it's just what I've been trying to do 

#### Maturity Mapping collaboration: Chris & Marc

Chris, Marc, and I got talking.
We got together for a couple of days at J.P.Morgan
Developed a workshop to guide teams to map their maturity
We continue to discuss & refine

## Technique

#### Review problem statement
Finding the most important aspect of a team to focus coaching efforts on

#### Maturity Mapping Workshop overview
#### Key Outcome - enable teams to map their maturity
##### Purpose
##### Interations
##### Stakeholder mapping
##### What do you do
##### Relations/dependencies
##### How developed/mature are the practices

## Application

#### Experimental Mindset
#### Key Outcome - use the maturity map to frame and measure experiments
##### Plot potential changes with the map
##### Define experiment: baseline, hypothisis, measure
##### Re-evaluate the map, verify position, understand the differences
##### Repeat with latest understanding


## Future work and challenges

#### Teams producing their maturity maps without our assistance, and making maps of other things 
#### Some interest from snr management
#### Tool rationalisation review
